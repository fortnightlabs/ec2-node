node.js on EC2
--------------

These are the steps needed to manually setup node.js on an EC2 instance.

**After you do the one-time setup** on your computer (information below),
you can use the provided shell scripts to setup and bundle a new
instance.

* `ec2-ubuntu` - creates an ubuntu server on ec2

    > ec2-ubuntu my-project

* `ubuntu-node` - sets up the server

    > ssh my-project ec2-node/ubuntu-node my-project

* `ec2-snapshot` - snapshot the newly created server

    > scp -r ~/.ec2 my-project:
    > ssh my-project "bash ec2-node/ec2-snapshot my-project"

* `ec2-node` - for the truly lazy. Does the create, clone, setup and the
  bundle in one glorious command.

    > ec2-node my-project

Both `ubuntu-node` and `ec2-snapshot` scripts expect you to already have
cloned the ec2-node github repository to the server.

    > ssh my-project "git clone git@github.com/fortnightlabs/ec2-node"

set up your computer
====================

**on your local machine**

go to the [amazon web
interface](https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html)

click on "Security Credentials" on the left

note your `AWS_USER_ID` (Account Number) in the upper right hand
corner; note your `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in the
middle

edit ~/.ec2/aws-keys

    > vi ~/.ec2/aws-keys

and save the information

    export AWS_USER_ID=XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xXxXXXxxXXXxXxxxXxxXXXXxXxXXxXxXxxXXxXxX

create a new X.509 certificate, download the private key and certificate
files, and then save the files in `$HOME/.ec2/`

    > mv ~/Downloads/*.pem ~/.ec2/

**note** you must create a new certificate in order to download the
private key. if you already have two X.509 certificates, Amazon will
not show you the interface to create another one. you will have to
delete one of your existing keys

setup permissions on `~/.ec2`

    chmod 0600 ~/.ec2/*
    chmod 0700 ~/.ec2

if needed, install the [tools for working with
ec2](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=351)

    > brew install ec2-api-tools
    > brew install ec2-ami-tools

add the following lines to your `.bash_profile`

    export JAVA_HOME="/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home"
    export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY="$(/bin/ls $HOME/.ec2/pk-*.pem)"
    export EC2_CERT="$(/bin/ls $HOME/.ec2/cert-*.pem)"
    export EC2_AMITOOL_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/ec2-ami-tools/1.3-45758/jars"
    export EC2_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/ec2-api-tools/1.3-62308/jars"
    source $HOME/.ec2/aws-keys

open a new shell, or

    > source ~/.bash_profile

if needed, create a new keypair for sever auth

    > ec2-add-keypair ec2-node > ec2-node.pem
    > chmod 0600 ec2-node.pem

copy that key to `~/.ec2/` as well

    > cp ec2-node.pem ~/.ec2/

create the server
=================

start-up a canonical provided ubuntu image (list of latest images
available at: <http://uec-images.ubuntu.com/releases/lucid/release/>),
here's the choice I made

* **us-east-1** - cheaper
* **32-bit** - more compatible, small and micro require it
* **ebs** - simpler storage, micro requires it

**note:** we're setting up the instance on a small (rather than micro)
platform because we need `/mnt` (not available on micro) to do the
bundling.  Once we have our new instance handy, we will move it to micro.

    > ec2-ubuntu am1.small ami-1234de7b us-east-1

the script will create a new instance and wait until it's running by
watching `ec2-describe-instances` for the string `running`

then the script will edit your `~/.ssh/config` file to make it easy to ssh
into the new instance

**note:** the `HostName` and `HostKeyAlias` will change based on the
output provided by `ec2-describe-instances`.

    Host my-project
      HostName ec2-67-202-82-82.compute-1.amazonaws.com
      HostKeyAlias ec2-67-202-82-82.compute-1.amazonaws.com
      User ubuntu
      ForwardAgent yes
      StrictHostKeyChecking no
      IdentityFile ~/.ec2/my-project.pem

now you can ssh into your instance

    > ssh my-project

set up the server
=================

**on your local machine**

copy the ubuntu-node script to the server

    > scp ubuntu-node my-project:

and then run it

    > ssh my-project "./ubuntu-node my-project"

the script will install useful utilities, then create an `apps` user for
the code to be deployed under (the scripts assume a capistrano
deployment strategy)

next, the script will set `upstart` to manage the node server process
and setup the sudoer priviledges correctly so the app user can restart
it.

finally, the script will install `node.js` and `npm` in the the
`/u/apps/.nodelocal` directory

now, we use need to use capistrano to finish deploying the code

    > export NODE_PROCESS="my-project"
    > cap deploy:setup
    > cap deploy:update
    > cap deploy:start

you can now visit <http://ec2-67-202-82-82.compute-1.amazonaws.com> (the
domain will be different) to make sure it works

deploying the instance
======================

going forward, you can simply deploy the instance with capistrano

    > NODE_PROCESS="my-project" cap deploy

**note** you really should copy the provided Capfile into your project
directory and change `#{ENV['NODE_PROCESS']}` to your application name
("my-project" in these examples)

bundle the instance
===================

**on your local machine**

copy your keys to the newly created server

    > scp -r ~/.ec2 my-project:

then, copy the ec2-snapshot script to the server

    > scp ec2-snapshot my-project:

finally run the snapshot script

    > ssh my-project "bash ec2-node/ec2-snapshot my-project"

the snapshot script will run `ec2-describe-instances` to find out
information about the instance

then it will run `ec2-describe-volumes` to find the volume that the
instance is using

next it will create a snapshot of the volume with `ec2-create-snapshot`

it will wait until the snapshot is completely by periodically checking
with `ec2-describe-snapshots`

when it finishes, the script will register the snapshot as an AMI with
amazon

    > ec2-register                      \
      --name my-project                 \
      --snapshot snap-1234abcde         \
      --kernel aki-1234abc              \  # from ec2-describe-instances
      --architecture i386               \
      --root-device-name /dev/sda1

after the image is registered, you will see output like `ami-1234de7b`

create a new instance from the AMI
==================================

Just run the ami identified in the output from the above step with
`ec2-run-instances`.  It should be all set-up and ready to go.

    > ec2-run-instances ami-98c035f1 --instance-type t1.micro --key ec2-node

A list of `--instance-type` options is available at
